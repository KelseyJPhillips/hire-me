# 3 negative criterias

### **📍 Localization**

- Berlin
- full remote
- part time remote for a company outside of Berlin would be somewhat okay if it isn't regularly commuting but maybe once per month or unique events like a week of onboarding

### **💰Money**

- freelancer contract with an hourly rate from 100€
- Arbeitnehmerüberlassung from 120k € annually
- full time contract in the range from 100k € annually

### **❌ Blacklist**

- anything anti democratic
- anything on the right side of politics or "conservative" values (no sexism, no homophobia, no racism etc.)
- anything on the "rejecting" side of refugees (Frontex!)
- anything climate destroying
- secret services (BND)
- military
- companies burning their people like Tesla
- NFT
- Cryptocurrencies
- Web 3.0
- Facebook
- advertising
- tracking
- general misuse of data (like in advertising)
- companies just utilizing "intellectual property" -> patent trolls

# 3 positive criterias

### 🛠️ Technology: 

Actually no real preferences here (I think I can get up to speed in unknown stacks fast). But most experience is in the following ones, ordered by personal preference:  
    
**Programming Languages**
- Go
- Java
- PHP
- Python

**Databases**
- PostgreSQL
- MariaDB/MySQL

**IaC**
- Terraform
- Ansible

**Container**
- Docker
- Kubernetes

**Cloud**
AWS

## 🛠️ Companies

- ecological impact (anti climate change)
- social impact

- WikiMedia
- Mozilla
- NGOs (the good ones)

- health
- interesting tech product

- Docker
- JetBrains
- HashiCorp

## 👨🏻‍🦰 People

people who care about each other and have similar values

  
## 🔝 Priority

- Freelancing (which is temporary): project > people > technology
- Arbeitnehmerüberlassung and full time: people > project > technology


# 👨🏻‍💻 Stack/Area

**Backend**
- Occasional frontend parts are okay (so part time full stack)
- Ops can be a part as well
- Infrastructure (setting up tools like the CI) can be a part as well

🥁 **Role**: 
- 50:50 engineer and manager. 
- Pure engineering positions are good as well. 

**Managing titles coming to my mind**: 
- Team Lead
- Engineering Lead
- VP of engineering
- CTO
