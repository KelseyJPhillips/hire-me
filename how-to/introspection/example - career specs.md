# 👨🏻‍💻 Stack/Area

- Backend
- Occasional frontend parts are okay (so part time full stack)
- Ops can be a part as well
- Infrastructure (setting up tools like the CI) can be a part as well

🥁 Role: 50:50 engineer and manager. Pure engineering positions are good as well. 

**Managing titles coming to my mind**: Team Lead, Engineering Lead, VP of engineering, CTO

# 3 negative criterias

- **📍 Localization**

- Berlin
- full remote
- part time remote for a company outside of Berlin would be somewhat okay if it isn't regularly commuting but maybe once per month or unique events like a week of onboarding

- **💰Money**

- freelancer contract with an hourly rate from 100€
- Arbeitnehmerüberlassung from 120k € annually
- full time contract in the range from 100k € annually

- **❌ Blacklist**

- anything anti democratic
- anything on the right side of politics or "conservative" values (no sexism, no homophobia, no racism etc.)
- anything on the "rejecting" side of refugees (Frontex!)
- anything climate destroying
- secret services (BND)
- military
- companies burning their people like Tesla
- NFT
- Cryptocurrencies
- Web 3.0
- Facebook
- advertising
- tracking
- general misuse of data (like in advertising)
- companies just utilizing "intellectual property" -> patent trolls
