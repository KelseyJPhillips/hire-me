## Experiences

## Crédit Agricole via CodeBusters
Senior Back-end Developer
Mai 2024 - June 2025
Paris

I worked in the investment bank of Crédit Agricole, in a pipeline of producing, normalising, enriching and consuming data about transactions that spans many many teams. 
My team was a central hub that received the data from the front-office, enrich it by communicating with other teams and hide the complexity of consuming it to various back-offices. 

Challenges: lots of regulation, lots of money involved, lots of trafic, observability, tracability and reliability are a must.
